# SciTE4AHK_GO
Home for SciTE4AHK GroggyOtter edition

(I haven't abandoned this. I'm actually quite intent on finishing it. However, real life problems have come up and I can't dedicate the time I want to this project. I love AHK and SciTE4AHK has always been my favorite editor, so resta assured that when I get the time, I will finish this.)

Currently, this project is under development and is in an Alpha stage (shit is broken, people! This is a WIP.)
When it becomes Beta, I will change this message.

Until then, please do not download this and try to use it.

Thank you!

(Still working it...soon, people. Soon. Posted:Jan2019)

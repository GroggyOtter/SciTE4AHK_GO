Recently finished:
Finished up the lexicon converter a while ago.
It now creates a fully functional API as well as a formatted KeyWords file. Plus, GUI! Very cool.

Currently working on:
Rewriting SciTE4AHK source. This...has become a slight problem. I know very little about C++ and the entire core of SciTE is written in it.
I'm currently trying to rework all the constants and checks this program uses to style everything.
Strongly considering just updating SciTE4AHK and releasing that so people can actually USE it and then continue working on SciTE4AHK_GO.
Will update this when I come up with something.
